@article{potato-heat,
	abstract = {Potato is the third most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat. Because of its widely distributed cultivation and high yields, it is considered a critical species in terms of food security in face of a growing world population. However, potato is particularly vulnerable to high temperature during various stages of its life cycle. Elevated temperatures strongly suppress tuberization, negatively affect storage and shelf life of tubers and reduce fitness of seed potatoes. Breeding new heat-stress tolerant cultivars is therefore an urgent need for sustainable increases in potato production. To achieve this goal an integrated approach combining physiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics is followed to analyze the impact of elevated temperatures on source-sink relations of potato plants, potato tuber development, starch accumulation and tuber quality and tuber dormancy. First results indicate that heat effects source-sink relations by altered expression of the tuber inducing signal FT, by stimulating shade-avoidance responses of the shoot and by decreasing sink-strength of developing tubers. Sink strength of growing potato tubers is mainly regulated by the activity of sucrose synthase. Measuring sucrose synthase expression and activity of heat grown potato tubers revealed a significant down-regulation of the enzyme which is consistent with reduced tuber growth. Interestingly, genetic variation in the activity of sucrose synthase exists, potentially enabling selection of potato varieties with heat-tolerant sucrose synthase isoforms. Although FT seems to play a major role in regulating tuberization, sink-derived and additional source signals are likely to be involved in orchestrating the heat-induced shift in assimilate allocation. This assumption is based on experiments in which soil and air temperatures of pot grown potato plants were independently controlled in growth chambers and transcript as well as sugar and enzyme profiles were recorded. Results of this analysis and their implication to improve heat tolerance of potato plants will be discussed.},

@article{FAO-drought,
	abstract = {Extreme weather disasters (EWDs) can jeopardize domestic food supply and disrupt commodity markets. However, historical impacts on European crop production associated with droughts, heatwaves, floods, and cold waves are not well understood---especially in view of potential adverse trends in the severity of impacts due to climate change. Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD. Using a compositing approach (superposed epoch analysis), we show that historical droughts and heatwaves reduced European cereal yields on average by 9{\%} and 7.3{\%}, respectively, associated with a wide range of responses (inter-quartile range +2{\%} to −23{\%}; +2{\%} to −17{\%}). Non-cereal yields declined by 3.8{\%} and 3.1{\%} during the same set of events. Cold waves led to cereal and non-cereal yield declines by 1.3{\%} and 2.6{\%}, while flood impacts were marginal and not statistically significant. Production losses are largely driven by yield declines, with no significant changes in harvested area. While all four event frequencies significantly increased over time, the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production roughly tripled over the last 50 years, from −2.2{\%} (1964--1990) to −7.3{\%} (1991--2015). Drought-related cereal production losses are shown to intensify by more than 3{\%} yr−1. Both the trend in frequency and severity can possibly be explained by changes in the vulnerability of the exposed system and underlying climate change impacts.},

@article{era5-steamflow,
	abstract = {Abstract In addition to having far-reaching impacts on human health, agriculture, wildfires, ecosystems, and infrastructure, heatwaves control streamflow through the melting of seasonal snow and glacier ice. Despite their importance, there is limited understanding of how heatwaves modify streamflow at regional scales, how these impacts vary by heatwave timing and duration, and how glaciers control the streamflow response. Here, we use a deep learning hydrological model, which has previously been trained, evaluated, and interpreted in southwestern Canada, to simulate the streamflow response to heatwaves at 111 basins in the region. The model, driven by gridded ERA5 reanalysis temperature and precipitation data from 1979 to 2015, is forced by synthetic heatwave conditions that vary in their duration and onset throughout the year. We consider how the streamflow response to heatwaves is sensitive to annual temperatures by adding spatially and temporally uniform warming of 2$\,^{\circ}$C across the study region, under the assumption that the underlying hydrological system behavior remains unchanged. We find that heatwaves, particularly in spring and summer, induce an initial streamflow surplus followed by a streamflow deficit, relative to the non-heatwave case. In summer, glacier contributions to streamflow partially compensate for streamflow deficits that arise from heatwaves earlier in the melt season. In the scenario with 2$\,^{\circ}$C warmer annual temperatures, heatwaves induce a lesser streamflow response in spring when the seasonal streamflow is most increased due to the advancing freshet. Our findings demonstrate how glaciers buffer the impacts of heatwaves on streamflow, but this buffering effect is expected to diminish as glaciers retreat.},

@article{2021-heatwave,
	abstract = {The 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave resulted in record temperatures observed across the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan as well as the US states of Washington and Oregon. Previous studies of extreme temperatures over arbitrarily-defined rectangular regions covering parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have estimated return periods of 200--100 000 years, generally based on data since 1950, with some analyses suggesting that the event would have been considered impossible based on statistical fits to pre-2021 data, or based on climate models failing to simulate such events. We estimate a return period of 1152 (126-∞) years for the 2021 event averaged over British Columbia, based on a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) with a location parameter a function of global mean surface temperature fitted to 1950--2021 ERA5 data. British Columbia was the province where the highest absolute temperature of 49.6 $\,^{\circ}$C was measured, and where the largest impacts on human mortality and ecosystems were reported. However, we show that this return period is reduced to 236 (52-∞) years when the analysis period is extended back to 1940, using newly-available ERA5 data, owing to an extreme heatwave observed in 1941. While the 1941 event was 1.7 $\,^{\circ}$C cooler than the 2021 event in British Columbia, it was a rarer event relative to the cooler climatology of the time, with an estimated return period of 735 (135-∞) years. Over this longer period we also find that almost all CMIP6 models underestimate variability in annual maximum temperatures over British Columbia. The return period of the 1941 heatwave was comparable to that of the 2021 event in Alberta and Saskatchewan, though not in Washington or Oregon. While the 2021 event was an unprecedented and extremely intense heatwave whose likelihood was much increased by human-induced climate change, our results indicate that this event was not as rare as previously thought in Western Canada.},
