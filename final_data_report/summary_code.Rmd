## Explanation

-   **`climate_extreme_RA`**: This is the root directory for the
    project.

    -   **`reports_station`**: Contains specific analyses for various
        stations. The `.Rmd` files are the scripts, and the `.html`
        files are the rendered results.

    -   **`final_data_report`**: Contains the final summary reports and
        associated code/data used to generate the summary. The
        `summary_code.Rmd` and `summary_data.Rmd` files contain the code
        and data detailed intro, allowing users to quickly understand
        the code/ data source and ensure easy reproductivyty. The
        `.html` file is a accordingly rendered report.

    -   `output`: This directory contains processed data files and
        results used for analysis. Each CSV file is associated with
        specific stations.

        -   **Raw Filtered Data:** Files with names like
            `Kelowna_raw_filtered_columns.csv`,`YVR_raw_filtered_columns.csv`.they
            contain the raw climate data from the temperature station
            that has only been filtered the necessary columns but did
            not do other data cleaning yet.

        -   **Percentiles Files:** These files provide statistical
            summaries of termperature percentile for different
            locations. For instance, `Kelowna_percentiles.csv` include
            90th and 95th percentile calculations relevant to the
            temperature data.

        -   **Monthly Max EHF Files:** These files capture the maximum
            Excess Heat Factor (EHF) per month for each station each
            year. Examples include `Kelowna_monthly_max_EHF.csv`,
            `FortNelson_monthly_max_EHF.csv`, and
            `Abbotsford_monthly_max_EHF.csv`.

        -   **Heatmap Files:** The data represent Heatwave for different
            location which is in the format that ready for heat map plot
            . Files such as `Kelowna_heatmap_5_dayHW.csv`,
            `EHF_heatmap_3_dayHW.csv` and
            `FortNelson_heatmap_3_dayHW_95.csv`. They indicate the
            heatwave duration (3-day or 5-day) and specific percentile
            threshold (e.g., 95th percentile by \_95 or default 90th
            percentile). The name also indecates the calculation method
            / way to define the heatwave, like EHF\_ or default the 95 /
            90 percentiles definition.

    ### Summary

    The data is organized by station names such as Kelowna, YVR,
    FortNelson, Prince George, Kamloops, and others. This organization
    facilitates easy reference and analysis of specific datasets,
    whether you are examining raw data, heatmaps, or percentile
    calculations.

    -   

    -   **`report_model`:** Contains the GEV (Generalized Extreme Value)
        model reports. The `.Rmd` files contain the code, and the
        `.html` files are the output reports.

    -   **`report_agricultural`:** Similar to `report_model`, but
        focused on agricultural data analysis.

    -   reportdrought

    -   report era5

    -   literature review

    -   **`R_model`:** This folder is dedicated to R scripts or models,
        likely for different analytical processes.

This structure helps in maintaining a clear organization of various
reports and their respective code, making it easy to navigate and
understand the different analyses performed.

#### ![]()**1. Station report**

The folder named `reports_station` contains a collection of R Markdown
(`.Rmd`) files and their corresponding HTML output files. These files
aim to the analysis of heat waves at specific weather stations across BC
province. And `.html` are the rendered outputs of the `.Rmd` files,
providing a user-friendly, web-based view of the analysis. They
typically include visualizations, summaries, and findings.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Contents:

`3_station_compare.Rmd`: A comparative analysis of heat waves across all
stations.

The rest is analysis of heat waves in specific temperature station
including:

-   `Kelowna_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

    -   In the Kelowna analysis, we examined the relationship between
        potato yield data and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) for the
        Kelowna station.

-   `YVR_heat_wave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `Prince_George_heat_wave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `Abbotsford_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `FortNelson_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `FortStJohn_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

    -   Fort St. John was included in the analysis because one of the
        crop datasets contains yield data for the Peace River Area, with
        Fort St. John chosen to represent that region.

### Summary:

The folder `reports_station` organizes heat wave analyses by location,
with both R Markdown scripts (`.Rmd`) and their corresponding HTML
outputs. This structure suggests that you are conducting detailed
studies on the impact of heat waves at various weather stations across
different regions, comparing and contrasting the findings where
relevant.

#### 1.1 Description:

We are examining daily climate data from temperature stations across
Canada, focusing on five key stations that are most representative of
the entire province of British Columbia. The dataset includes the
following columns:

**x**: Longitude

**y**: Latitude

**LOCAL_DATE**: Date in the format year-month-day
**TOTAL_PRECIPITATION**: Total precipitation in mm

**STATION_NAME**: Name of the station

**MEAN_TEMPERATURE**: Mean of daily maximum and minimum temperatures

**MAX_TEMPERATURE**: Daily maximum temperature

**MIN_TEMPERATURE**: Daily minimum temperature

**TOTAL_RAIN**: Total rainfall

**MIN_REL_HUMIDITY**: Minimum relative humidity

**LOCAL_YEAR**: Year

**LOCAL_MONTH**: Month

*Our goal is to identify stations with data extending back to 1941 in
order to compare the heatwave of 1941 with that of 2021.*
