## R code and File Structure Overview

The summary of the R code structure is as follows:

-   **`climate_extreme_RA`**: This is the root directory for the
    project.

    -   **`reports_station`**: Contains specific analyses for various
        stations. The `.Rmd` files are the scripts, and the `.html`
        files are the rendered results.

    -   **`final_data_report`**: Contains the final summary reports and
        associated code/data used to generate the summary.

        -   The `summary_code.Rmd` and `summary_data.Rmd` files contain
            the code and data detailed intro, allowing users to quickly
            understand the code/ data source and ensure easy
            reproductivyty. The `.html` file is a accordingly rendered
            report.

        -   The `requirements.txt` file lists all the
            dependencies—specific the exact versions of each libraries
            and packages—that this R project needs to function
            correctly.

    -   **`output`**: This directory contains processed data files and
        results used for analysis. Each CSV file is associated with
        specific stations including raw filtered data, heatwave data for
        heatmap plots, percentiles, and monthly maxEHF.

    -   **`report_model`:** Contains GEV model reports for annual
        maximum EHF and average exceedance values at various stations.
        The `.Rmd` files contain the code, and the `.html` files are the
        output reports.

    -   **`report_agricultural`:** This section is focused on
        agricultural data analysis and includes two detailed reports:
        `FAOSTAT.Rmd` and `Agri_lm_model.Rmd`.

    -   `report_drought`:This section focuses on the analysis of dry
        periods, including the maximum consecutive dry days
        (`max_consec`) and average exceedance of the avg temperature
        days (`avgexc`). Within the report, there are 2 anaysis:

        -   Correlation Analysis: Scatter plots are generated, with the
            top 20 data points highlighted for clarity.

        -   Ranking: Analysis includes ranking based on `max_consec` and
            `avgexc`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This structure helps in maintaining a clear organization of various
reports and their respective code, making it easy to navigate and
understand the different analyses performed.

#### ![]()**1. Station report**

The folder named `reports_station` contains a collection of R Markdown
(`.Rmd`) files and their corresponding HTML output files. These files
aim to the analysis of heat waves at specific weather stations across BC
province. And `.html` are the rendered outputs of the `.Rmd` files,
providing a user-friendly, web-based view of the analysis. They
typically include visualizations, summaries, and findings.

Detailed Breakdown of the Contents:

`3_station_compare.Rmd`: A comparative analysis of heat waves across all
stations.

The rest is analysis of heat waves in specific temperature station
including:

-   `Kelowna_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

    -   In the Kelowna analysis, we examined the relationship between
        potato yield data and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) for the
        Kelowna station.

-   `YVR_heat_wave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `Prince_George_heat_wave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `Abbotsford_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `FortNelson_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

-   `FortStJohn_heatwave_analysis.Rmd`

    -   Fort St. John was included in the analysis because one of the
        crop datasets contains yield data for the Peace River Area, with
        Fort St. John chosen to represent that region.

#### Summary:

The folder `reports_station` organizes heat wave analyses by location,
with both R Markdown scripts (`.Rmd`) and their corresponding HTML
outputs. This structure suggests that you are conducting detailed
studies on the impact of heat waves at various weather stations across
different regions, comparing and contrasting the findings where
relevant.

#### 2. Output

-   **Raw Filtered Data:** Files with names like
    `Kelowna_raw_filtered_columns.csv`,`YVR_raw_filtered_columns.csv`
    contain the raw climate data from the temperature stations. These
    datasets have been filtered to retain only the necessary columns,
    but no further data cleaning has been performed.

-   **Percentiles Files:** These files provide statistical summaries of
    termperature percentile for different locations. For instance,
    `Kelowna_percentiles.csv` include 90th and 95th percentile
    calculations relevant to the temperature data.

-   **Monthly Max EHF Files:** These files capture the maximum Excess
    Heat Factor (EHF) per month for each station each year. Examples
    include `Kelowna_monthly_max_EHF.csv`,
    `FortNelson_monthly_max_EHF.csv`, and
    `Abbotsford_monthly_max_EHF.csv`.

-   **Heatmap Files:** The data in these files represents heatwaves for
    different locations and is formatted for heatmap plotting. Files
    such as `Kelowna_heatmap_5_dayHW.csv`, `EHF_heatmap_3_dayHW.csv` and
    `FortNelson_heatmap_3_dayHW_95.csv`. They indicate the heatwave
    duration (3-day or 5-day) and specific percentile threshold (e.g.,
    95th percentile indicated by \_95 or the default 90th percentile).
    The file names also indicate the method used to define the heatwave,
    such as `EHF_` or the default percentile-based definition.

#### Summary

The data is organized by station names such as Kelowna, YVR, FortNelson,
Prince George, Kamloops, and others. This organization facilitates easy
reference and analysis of specific datasets, whether you are examining
raw data, heatmaps, or percentile calculations.
